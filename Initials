- MUST
React + Tailwind
Express + MongoDB
OpenAI API (for e-agent)
OAuth2.0 for social media
BullMQ + Redis for scheduling
Docker + GitHub Actions + Railway/Vercel

üöÄ Should-Have for v1
Rate limiting, Helmet.js, Joi
Cloudinary/S3 for media
CI/CD and environment separation
Sentry for error tracking

üß† Nice-to-Have for Scaling
Modular Microservices
PostHog/Mixpanel
Grafana + Prometheus
API gateway and service discovery (if scaling massively)

TO BEGIN WITH: 
AWS (Amazon Web Services)
üîß For hosting servers, storing media (S3), deploying containers (ECS/EKS), and using scalable infrastructure.

Microservices Architecture
üß© Split your app into independent services (e.g., auth service, AI service, scheduler service) for better scalability and maintenance.

Docker + Docker Compose
üì¶ To containerize your frontend, backend, Redis, etc., ensuring consistent environments across dev, staging, and production.

MongoDB Atlas
üóÉ Cloud-based NoSQL database for storing users, posts, history, and analytics ‚Äî reliable and highly scalable.

Redis + BullMQ
‚è± For managing scheduled posts, caching sessions, and handling background tasks efficiently.

CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)
üöÄ Automatically test and deploy your app to production with every commit ‚Äî ensures faster, error-free updates.

OAuth 2.0 Integration
üîê Secure, token-based access to social media platforms (Facebook, X, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.)

OpenAI API (or HuggingFace Transformers)
üß† For AI features like generating captions, summarizing messages, auto-replies, and assisting in post creation.
